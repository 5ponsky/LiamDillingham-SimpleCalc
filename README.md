A simple calculator I made to teach to a class

This was one of the projects that I created to teach to my Programming I & II class.  After figuring out how to do it myself,
I then attempted to teach it (with some success) to the other students in the class.

Most didn't care, some just slept. 
one or two actually cared, and thought it was cool that they could make their own calculator, "just like the one in windows". 

But hey, it beats watching "hacker" movies every class period haha.
